     First of all, you need to install Maya 2017 through its proper installer. After the installation, you will have
     available **Autodesk Desktop App** also. This is the app that we will use to update our version to Maya to Update 5.

     > Autodesk Desktop App Icon on System Trail in Windows
    ![Autodesk App](../img/autodesk_app_icon.png?style=centerme)

    Double click on the app icon, and the Autodesk Desktop App window will pop up

     > Autodesk Desktop App Interface
    ![Autodesk Win Install 1](../img/maya_install_win_1.png?style=centerme)

    In that window just press the **Update** button on Maya 2017 Update 5 - Windows version and your Maya version will be
    updated (in can take with a lot of time).
